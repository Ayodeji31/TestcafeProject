# testcafe POC

This contains a very simple POC for the testcafe library. It contains 2 test fixtures that search for Github repositories.

## Outcomes

- Incredibly easy to get up and running, 1 depedency total, docs are great
- Works for a variety of browsers out of the box
- Does has official browserstack integration (not used)
- Concurrency is trivial (-c flag in the scripts)
- Running against multiple browsers at the same time is easy (see test:all script)
- API seems great
